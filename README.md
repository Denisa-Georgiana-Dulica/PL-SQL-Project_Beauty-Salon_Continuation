# PL-SQL-Project_Beauty-Salon_Continuation
Based on the database that I initially created in the Database-Project_Beauty-Salon project, I formulated several complex exercises in which I used control structures, courses, exception handling, procedures, triggers, functions and packages.
At the end of the project I created a web application through the App Builder module in Apex where I designed a Master Detail page and 2 reports, one containing information about employees and the other information about clients and their appointments.
